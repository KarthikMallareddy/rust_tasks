/**
 * Minimal test example demonstrating zero-knowledge encryption workflow.
 *
 * This example:
 * 1. Creates a vault entry with site credentials
 * 2. Encrypts it with a master password
 * 3. Simulates storing the encrypted data
 * 4. Decrypts it with the correct password (succeeds)
 * 5. Attempts to decrypt with wrong password (fails)
